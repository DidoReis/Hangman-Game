# Hangman Game

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. This implementation provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `hangman.py` in a Python environment.
2. The program will randomly select a word from a predefined list.
3. Guess letters by entering them when prompted.
4. You have a limited number of tries before the game is over.
5. If you correctly guess all the letters, you win the game!
